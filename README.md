# LuminDER

LuminDER is a dating app for NUS students that takes on the familiar interface of LumiNUS and is a wordplay on Tinder.

## About
This project was created by a 4-member team during [Hack&Roll 2021](https://hacknroll2021.devpost.com/) hackathon organised by [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org/). You may view our submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/luminder).

## How we built it

We used the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node), Bootstrap for styling and Firebase for authentication.

## Challenges we ran into

Team was inexperienced with web development, unfamiliar with Firebase and React context, file uploading and missed out on some design issues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Setting up the entire project base from scratch, learning/re-learning React Bootstrap, setting up a chat page, solve the card matching problem, solving authentication issues

## What we learned

Project setup and structuring, system design, database management

## What's next for LuminDER

Make the chat real-time using web sockets and fix login issues.
